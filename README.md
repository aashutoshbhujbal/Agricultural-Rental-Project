# Agricultural Product Rental
The Agricultural Product Rental System project aims to develop a platform that allows 
farmers to rent out their agricultural products, such as farm equipment and machinery, to other 
farmers who require them. 
The system provides an online marketplace where farmers can list their products, set 
rental prices, and communicate with potential renters. The platform features a payment system 
that facilitates secure transactions between renters and farmers, as well as a rating and review 
system to encourage trust and accountability. 
By providing a convenient and cost-effective way for farmers to access agricultural 
products, the Agricultural Product Rental System aims to improve productivity and reduce costs 
in the agricultural industry.
